        <pre class="story-content" id="content">
          The first day of school after Golden Week.

          An inexplicable event occurred for me, Shijo Haruto.

          "What is this..."

          I found an envelope in my shoe box. It was sealed with a pink heart-shaped sticker.

          Upon checking the contents, I found a favorable message written specifically for me, and at the end, it said, "Please come to the courtyard after school" in rounded handwriting<sup><a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" style="color: #9619D0;">[1]</a></sup>.

          If I were to accept it straightforwardly, it would be considered a love letter.

          However, my mood remains at a low altitude. In fact, sighs escape me from time to time.

          "...Haa."
          
          If you're a man who's hungry for women, this is a development that would normally cause your tension to explode.
          
          It's possible that I might have a girlfriend by the end of today. It would be strange not to be happy about it.
          
          However, I understand reality well.
          
          So, I couldn't rejoice without reservations.
          
          Let me briefly explain the reason.
          
          First of all, the method of a love letter is too classic and lacks realism.
          
          In addition, the sender of the letter is unknown.
          
          It could be said that it's a dubious method utilizing anonymity.
          
          And above all, I am a pure non-realizer. I have hardly any contact with girls.
          
          In other words, there is no way someone would have feelings for me.
          
          Based on the aforementioned reasons, it can be speculated that this love letter is an act of harassment from someone.
          
          The culprit is unknown, but it is likely someone from my classmates. Truly, being a social outcast is tough.
          
          I let out another sigh and put the envelope into my bag.
          
          <i class="fas fa-star" style="font-size: 10px;"></i>
          
          Later, when it was time for physical education, I opened my shoe locker to go out to the field, only to find another letter inside. It said to meet on the rooftop after school.
          
          Since the handwriting is different, it can be assumed that there are multiple culprits. ...Haa. 
          
          <i class="fas fa-star" style="font-size: 10px;"></i>
          
          As after-school approached, I didn't rush straight home—no, I didn't do that.
          
          Now I'm going to the place where I was called by the letter.
          
          It's like willingly walking into a dangerous situation, but ignoring the calls would bring about various complications.
          
          The culprit who sent me the letter probably wants to see my reaction and derive enjoyment from it.
          
          If I were to disappoint their expectations, I would likely incur their resentment.
          
          So, I need to answer the call even if I don't want to go.
          
          This is also unavoidable in order to maintain a peaceful school life.
          
          I was called to both the rooftop and the courtyard, but it would be more efficient to start with the rooftop since it's closer in proximity.
          
          I slowly stood up and made my way towards the rooftop—
          
          "C-Can I have a moment. Shijo-kun!"
          
          Just as I was about to head there, a classmate called out to me. Using a gentle and appealing tone that seemed to be popular among guys.
          
          Hiiragi Hina. She is a beautiful girl with softly wavy flaxen hair and big sparkling blue eyes as her distinctive features.
          
          She has the admirable quality of treating everyone equally and willingly taking on even troublesome tasks.
          
          One could say she's a true "sunshine character"<sup><a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2" style="color: #9619D0;">[2]</a></sup>. She has an impeccable appearance and personality, leaving no room for criticism.
          
          I wonder why Hiiragi-san would have any business with me. Is it about swapping cleaning duties or something? But Hiiragi-san isn't the type of person to do something like that.
          
          "Y-Yeah, it's fine. Do you need something?"
          
          Feeling perplexed and unable to gather my thoughts, I respond with a puzzled tone.
          
          And she, with a tense expression on her face.
          
          "Well, you see, there's something I want to talk to you about, Shijo-kun... Can we move to a different location for now?"
          
          "...O-Okay."
          
          I'm not sure why we need to change locations, but it is the duty of a shady person to obey the words of a sunshine character like her.
          
          As I nodded my head, Hiiragi-san swiftly turned on her heel and began walking with uncertain steps that resembled those of a robot.
          
          
          Hiiragi-san already stands out, and with her peculiar behavior, the attention on her only doubles. Since I dislike standing out, I decided to keep my distance from her as much as possible and follow behind her.
          
          After about five minutes of walking, we arrived at the back of the gymnasium. It seemed that club activities hadn't started yet, as there was no sign of anyone around. It was a perfect place for a secretive conversation.
          
          "I'm sorry. You had to go out of your way to get here. Did I bother you?"
          
          "No, more importantly, what did you want to talk about?"
          
          "Ah, yeah. Um, there's this consultation that I really want to have you help me with, Shijo-kun."
          
          Hiiragi-san fidgeted and played with her hands as she began to speak.
          
          A consultation, huh. I don't understand why she chose me as her consultant, but I can see why she wanted to change the location. It's difficult to have a conversation like that in a crowded place like the classroom.
          
          "You know, I've never had a boyfriend before. But now that I've entered my second year, I've been thinking that it's time for me to get at least one boyfriend, you know~ So, um, I'm looking for a boyfriend!"
          
          Hiiragi-san's cheeks turned red—or rather, they became completely flushed—as she said that.
          
          Does she think of me as some kind of matching app bulletin board<sup><a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3" style="color: #9619D0;">[3]</a></sup> or something? If she's looking for a boyfriend, I wish she would do it in a more appropriate setting....
          
          "Um, if you want a boyfriend, why don't you just confess to someone directly?"
          
          "N-No way, it's impossible! I can't imagine myself recovering if I were rejected. So, Shijo-kun, could you please somehow help me find a boyfriend!?"
          
          What does she really think of me? Does she see me as some kind of handyman? Even a handyman wouldn't be asked for such a request.
          
          Seriously, this has gone beyond a simple consultation.
          
          "Well, even if you say that to me... I think that if it's you, Hiiragi-san, you can date most guys unless you're extremely picky. Oh, by the way, as a basic premise, do you have someone you like?"
          
          "Y-Yes, there is someone. I've had feelings for him for a long time."
          
          "Does that person have a lover?"
          
          "I don't think so. If he did, I think I would have noticed."
          
          "I see. In that case, you should confess to him. Unless he is an eccentric, I don't think he will reject your confession. No, I'm confident they won't reject you."
          
          "Really? Like, really, really?"
          
          "Yeah, I promise."
          
          Hiiragi-san leaned forward, closing the distance between us. I could feel her breath getting slightly heavier.
          
          Has she never looked in the mirror? I would imagine that with Hiiragi-san's level of appearance and a good personality, the chances of being rejected are extremely low.
          
          "Then, if I get rejected, will Shijo-kun take responsibility?"
          
          As Hiiragi-san looks up at me, she says.
          
          I'm not one to take responsibility, but well, it shouldn't be a problem. The chances of Hiiragi-san getting rejected are close to zero.
          
          "I'll take responsibility within my capabilities."
          
          "Thank you. Well then, I'll gather my courage and confess my feelings."
          
          "Okay. Good luck."
          
          "Yeah, I'll do my best."
          
          Hiiragi-san, with both hands tightly clasped in front of her chest, displayed her determination. I thought the conversation was coming to an end, but there was still no sign of it being over.
          
          Hiiragi-san showed no signs of leaving the place. On the contrary, she placed her hand on her chest and began taking deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling repeatedly.
          
          I looked at her in bewilderment, and then Hiiragi-san stared at me intently.
          
          "I've liked you for a long time, Shijo-kun. Please, go out with me!"
