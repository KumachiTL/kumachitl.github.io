        <pre id="content">
            In our high school, benches and tables are installed throughout the outdoor areas, perhaps as places of relaxation. On sunny days, there are quite a few people who use them. Although I have never used them before today, I am now sitting on one of those benches for the first time, enjoying my lunch.

            "I don't agree with it."
        
            Anna, who was sitting next to me, said as soon as I started eating. 
        
            The reason I'm eating here instead of in the classroom is because Anna asked me to. Anna and I always ate together since we were seated in front of and behind each other, and there was no need to move, but I thought there must be a reason, so I accepted without hesitation.
        
            "What do you mean... you don't agree?"
        
            After what had happened with Shiori, my conversations with Anna had been awkward. That's why I was relieved when she invited me like this. For me, Anna is my closest friend in class, and I feel comfortable with her. I enjoy spending time talking lightly, and because of this, I feel comfortable in the classroom. I don't want to ruin this relationship.
        
            "Of course it's about Ayashiro-san. There are a lot of things I want to ask you, but... first of all, ...what kind of relationship do Isakacchi and Ayashiro-san have? Are you really dating?"
        
            "So that's what you mean. Me and Ayashiro... me and Shiori are dating for the time being. Or rather, it's more like we ended up dating." 
        
            I told Anna everything I could tell her. How it all started, how it was all a misunderstanding, my past, the fact that Shiori had feelings for me, and how we decided to continue our relationship. I couldn't read what Anna was thinking from her expression when she was listening to me.
        
            "...Why would you do that?..." [TL: I think she's referring to the ex-girlfriend(?)]
        
            "Hmm? What's wrong?"
        
            "Nothing. I didn't know Isakacchi had a girlfriend."
        
            "Well, even though we were dating, we were in middle school, so she was cute. We were both so pure.... That's why I was hurt."
        
            "I see.... But you're still dragging it out, aren't you? Is it safe to go out with her like that?"
        
            "That's right...., but Shiori knew that and said, 'I like you.' She also said, 'I won't betray you.' Not that we shouldn't break up, but at least I don't think she'd cheat on me or anything. Besides, I can't keep dragging this out forever either."
        
            "... What does Isakacchi think of Ayashiro-san in the first place? If you don't like her and you're just going out with her, I don't think it's a good idea."
        
            "I like Shiori. But that's not the same as romantic feelings. But hey, isn't it pure joy to be liked by someone?"
        
            I don't know if it's Manaka's fault, or if it's because I'm not confident to begin with, but even I have my preferences. [TL: Manaka is the ex-girlfriend]
        
            "I think I like people who like me. On the contrary, I'm happy when any person likes me, not just Shiori. So it may seem like a convenience, but I'm pretty sure I'm conscious of Shiori."
        
            Even an ambiguous relationship can be a good start. It doesn't matter what other people think, as long as Shiori and I are satisfied with it.
        
            "... Does that mean it doesn't matter who as long as they like as you like them Isakacchi?"
        
            "Not everyone, but... Well, I guess I don't really want anything else."
        
            "You mean it's possible that it's not Ayashiro-san?"
        
            "Huh? Possible? No, no, I don't care about that right now."
        
            "It's not good! Because I alsoâ€”"
        
            "There you are. Mou, I've been searching for you, you know?"
        
            I somehow knew that Anna was about to say something important. But her words were interrupted by Shiori, who may or may not have had the right timing.
