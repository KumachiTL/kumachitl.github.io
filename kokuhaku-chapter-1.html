        <div class="kc1">
          <br />The first day of school after Golden Week.<br />
          <br />For me, Haruto Shijo, something inexplicable happened.<br />
          <br />"What's this......"<br />
          <br />I found an envelope in my shoe box. It was sealed with a pink heart-shaped sticker.<br />
          <br />I checked the contents, and found that it was filled with a nice note to me, and at the end it said, "Come to the courtyard after school," written in circled letters.<br />
          <br />If we were to take it honestly, it would be a love letter.<br />
          <br />However, my tension is still at a low level. In fact, I can't help but sigh.<br />
          <br />"...... Haa."<br />
          <br />If you're a man who's hungry for women, this is a development that would normally cause your tension to explode.<br />
          <br />You might get a girlfriend today. It's strange not to be happy about it.<br />
          <br />But I'm well aware of the reality.<br />
          <br />So, I could not be happy to let it go.<br />
          <br />Let me briefly explain why.<br />
          <br />First, a love letter is too classic a technique to be realistic.<br />
          <br />In addition, the sender of the letter is unknown.<br />
          <br />This is a vicious means of taking advantage of anonymity.<br />
          <br />Above all, I am a genuine non-religious person. I don't have much contact with girls.<br />
          <br />In other words, there is no way they would like me.<br />
          <br />With the above, it can be inferred that this love letter is harassment from someone.<br />
          <br />I don't know who the culprit is, but it is probably one of my classmates. Good grief, it's hard to be a shady person.<br />
          <br />I let out another sigh and put the envelope back in my bag.<br />
          <br />-
          <br />
          <br />Later, when it was time for PE and I opened the shoe box to go out to the field, I found another letter. They wanted me to come to the rooftop after school.<br />
          <br />Since the handwriting is different, it is safe to assume that there is more than one culprit...... Haa.<br />
          <br />-
          <br />
          <br />After school arrived, I didn't rush home.<br />
          <br />Now I'm going to the place where I was called by the letter.<br />
          <br />It's like going to the place of death myself, but ignoring the call is more trouble than it's worth.<br />
          <br />The person who sent me the letter would enjoy seeing my reaction.<br />
          <br />If I fail to meet their expectations, they will be antagonistic.<br />
          <br />So I need to answer the call even if I don't want to go.<br />
          <br />This is also the only way to have a peaceful school life.<br />
          <br />I was called to the rooftop and the courtyard, but it would be more efficient to go to the rooftop first in order of proximity.<br />
          <br />I slowly sat up and went to the rooftop——<br />
          <br />"C-Can I have a word for a moment. Shijo-kun!"<br />
          <br />Just as I was about to head to the rooftop, I was stopped by a classmate. A soft voice that seems to be very popular with men.<br />
          <br />Hiiragi Hina. She is a beautiful girl with softly wavy flaxen hair and big blue eyes.<br />
          <br />She has a good personality, taking the initiative to do even the most troublesome things.<br />
          <br />She is a true cheery person. She is a person of impeccable appearance and character.<br />
          <br />What does Hiiragi-san want from me? Is she asking me to take over the cleaning duty?<br />
          <br />But Hiiragi-san is not that type of person.<br />
          <br />"Y-Yeah I don't mind, but what do you want?"<br />
          <br />Unable to wrap my head around it, I respond with a puzzled look.<br />
          <br />She looked nervous.<br />
          <br />"Well, there's something I want to talk to you about...... but for now, can we move to a different location?"<br />
          <br />"...... O-Okay."<br />
          <br />Why she moved places is a mystery, but it is the duty of a shady person to absolutely comply with what a cheery person says.<br />
          <br />When I shook my head, Hiiragi-san turned on her heel and started walking with unsteady, robot-like steps.<br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san is a conspicuous person, but her strange behavior doubles the amount of attention. Not liking to stand out, I decided to follow her, keeping my distance from Hiiragi-san as much as possible.<br />
          <br />After walking for about five minutes, we arrived at the back of the gymnasium. Perhaps club activities had not started yet, but there was no sign of anyone. It was the perfect place to have a secret conversation.<br />
          <br />"I'm sorry. You had to go out of your way to get here. Did I bother you?"<br />
          <br />"Nah, what do you want to talk about?"<br />
          <br />"Ah, yeah. Um, I had a consultation that I really wanted Shijo-kun to solve."<br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san starts out while playing with her hands.<br />
          <br />Consultation, huh. I don't know what her intention was in choosing me as a consultant, but I understand why she moved to a different place. It's hard to ask for advice in a crowded place like a classroom.<br />
          <br />"I've never had a boyfriend before. But now that I'm moving up to the second grade, I think it's time for me to get at least one boyfriend. So, um, I'm looking for a boyfriend!"<br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san says with a blush—or rather, a bright red blush—on her cheeks.<br />
          <br />Does she think I'm on a matching app message board or something? If you are looking for a boyfriend, please do it in the right place.......<br />
          <br />"Errr, if you want a boyfriend, why don't you just confess your feelings?"<br />
          <br />"I-It's impossible, impossible, impossible! I'm not sure I can recover from this for the rest of my life if I'm rejected. So, Shijo-kun, please make me a boyfriend somehow!?"<br />
          <br />Really, what does she really think I am? Even a handyman should not be asked to do this.<br />
          <br />I mean, it's not a consultation.<br />
          <br />"No, you don't have to say that to me. I think Hiiragi-san can go out with most guys if she is not too choosy. Oh, that's right. As a prerequisite, is there someone you like?"<br />
          <br />"Y-Yeah, I have. Someone I have liked for a long time."<br />
          <br />"Does he have a girlfriend?" <br />
          <br />"I don't think so. If he did, I'm sure I'd notice." <br />
          <br />"I see. Then you should confess to him. Unless he is an eccentric, I don't think he will reject your confession. No, I can say that you will never be rejected."<br />
          <br />"Really? Really, really?"<br />
          <br />"Yeah, I promise." <br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san closes the distance between us, leaning forward. She is sniffing faintly.<br />
          <br />Have you never looked in the mirror? I'm sure you can imagine that with Hiiragi-san's level of appearance and personality, the chances of being turned down are extremely low.<br />
          <br />"Then, if I get dumped, will Shijo-kun take the blame?"<br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san says, looking me up and down.<br />
          <br />I'm the kind of person who doesn't want to be responsible, but well, it doesn't matter. The chances of Hiiragi-san being dumped are equal to zero.<br />
          <br />"I'll take as much responsibility as I can handle."<br />
          <br />"Thanks. Then I'll be brave and confess my feelings." <br />
          <br />"Okay. Good luck."<br />
          <br />"Yeah, I'll do my best."<br />
          <br />Hiiragi-san showed no sign of walking away. On the contrary, she was placing her hands on her chest and repeatedly taking deep breaths.<br />
          <br />I looked at her suspiciously. Then, Hiiragi-san stared at me.<br />
          <br />"I have been in love with Shijo-kun for a long time. Please go out with me!"<br />
