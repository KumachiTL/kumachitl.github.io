          <br />For example.<br />
          <br />What would people do if they were confessed to three times in one day?<br />
          <br />Some would go out with the first person who confessed to them.<br />
          <br />Some would go out with the girl of their choice, and some would not go out with anyone.<br />
          <br />Incidentally, for a sullen, non-motivated guy like me, I choose to go out with everyone.<br />
          <br />You may think I'm a scumbag, but wait a minute.<br />
          <br />Think about it calmly.<br />
          <br />Usually, there's no way a coincidence would happen that they would confess on the same day. There are not many people in the world who would love someone like me, someone who is ranked as low as I am. It would be like finding a grain of sand in the desert.<br />
          <br />Therefore, it is very likely that the people who confessed to me did so for the purpose of ridicule or as a punishment.<br />
          <br />That's why, in my case, if I get confessions from three people, I choose to go out with all of them.<br />
          <br />If I reject the confession, I will be on the wrong side of the table, and it is safer to go out with all of them.<br />
          <br />Well, even if I do go out with them, I will be immediately rejected or ridiculed by them, saying, "Of course it's a joke."<br />
          <br />"Hey Haruto-kun. Why did you cheat on me? What were you dissatisfied with?"<br />
          <br />"H-Haru-kun's stupid! Y-You told me you loved me......"<br />
          <br />"Why? ...... Haruto."<br />
          <br />Then why am I surrounded by three beautiful girls right now?<br />
          <br />Why do all of them have tears in their eyes?<br />
          <br />Maybe I've done something terrible......?<br />
          <br />I was experiencing difficulties for the first time in my life, and my whole body was soaked with sweat.<br />
          <br /> ä¸€<br />
          <br />TN: New series (to translate). Despite the long title, it caught my interest so I'll try translating this. Tell me any errors, as always.<br />
          <br />PS: You can also suggest any stories/novels in the comments. (As long as they're webnovels)</div>
