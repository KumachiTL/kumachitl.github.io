          <br />For instance.<br />
          <br />If someone were confessed to three times in one day, what would they do?<br />
          <br />Some would go out with the first person who confessed to them.<br />
          <br />Some would go out with the girl of their choice, and some would not go out with anyone.<br />
          <br />Incidentally, in the case of a sultry, unfriendly guy like me, I choose to "go out with all of them".<br />
          <br />You may think I'm a scumbag, but wait a minute.<br />
          <br />Think about it calmly.<br />
          <br />Normally, there's no way that it would be a coincidence that they would confess their feelings for me on the same day. There are not many people in the world who would fall in love with someone as low on the human ranking as I am. It would be like finding a grain of sand in the desert.<br />
          <br />Therefore, it is very likely that those who confessed were doing so for the purpose of ridicule or as a punishment.<br />
          <br />So, in my case, if I were confessed to by three people, I would choose to go out with all of them.<br />
          <br />If I were to reject the confession, it would cause conflicts, and going out with all of them is a safer option.<br />
          <br />Well, even if I do go out with them, I'll probably be dumped right away or ridiculed with a 'It was obviously a joke' kind of ending.<br />
          <br />"Hey Haruto-kun. Why did you cheat on me? What were you dissatisfied with?"<br />
          <br />"H-Haru-kun, you idiot! Y-You told me you loved me..."<br />
          <br />"Why? ...Haruto."<br />
          <br />Then why am I now surrounded by three beautiful girls?<br />
          <br />Why do all of them have tears in their eyes?<br />
          <br />Perhaps I've done something terrible...?<br />
          <br />I was experiencing my first major crisis in life, and my entire body was covered in sweat.
